    <span> Have you ever wondered why work flows so well organized in industrial production lines, however pretty rarely in the office where specialists need to cooperate? </span>
    <br>
    <span>Then, Lonely-Lobster might be for you! </span>
    <br>
    <span>Lonely-Lobster allows you to model multiple value chains, control influx of new work, assign workers to the process steps and even share them between various process steps. 
    Then run a simulation and observe how the workers learn to select the best strategies which work item to pick next. You want to apply work-in-progress limits to steamline the flow through the value chains? 
    Do it yourself or let Lonely-Lobster help you to find good settings. Play around with the parameters and see how they influence statistical data such as the overall performance.</span>
